# Google Maps and FourSqaure API - Neighbourhood map

###### About

This is my submission for project #7 for the Front End Web Developer nanodegree at Udacity. The challenge was to create a KnockoutJS powered app using APIs including Google Maps and FourSquare.

The app pulls the most popular spots surrounding an area of interest and pins them on a google map. The location of interest is Katoomba, NSW, Australia.
